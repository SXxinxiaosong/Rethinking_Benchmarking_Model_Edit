## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Replacing `MODEL_PATH` `MODEL_NAME`**
Before running the evaluation, you need to specify the path to your model. In the `eval.sh` script, update the `MODEL_PATH` to point to the location of your pre-trained or edited model.

### 2. **Running the Evaluation**
```bash
bash eval.sh
```

### 3. **Result**
The evaluation results will be saved in the MODEL_NAME file.
